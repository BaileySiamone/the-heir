Characters
==========
**Tom**, 28: At the outset: lonely, isolated, listless, the weight of the world on his shoulders.

**Claire**, 25: Girl-next-door, literally--has the storage unit next to Tom's.
Tom's eventual love interest.
Tom's foil: he can describe to her the significance of objects he finds.
Claire is using her unit to store possessions following a breakup.
She, too, has stuff to sort through, but less than Tom.

**Drake**, 29: Tom's step-brother.
High school football star, ladies' man and all-American pride and joy of his parents.
Golden child and Tom's nemesis throughout their childhood.
Drake may be absent physically in act I, but Tom's recollections and complaints introduce him from the start.
Drake peaked at 19 as a college football rookie and is unwilling to accept this disappointment.
Nothing happened in his life in the decade since, and is unlikely to happen ever again.
Drake represents the path of accepting only happy facts and ignoring the disappointing.

Alternatively, **Drake**, 59, Tom's step-father.
Peaked as a college quarterback who never went pro.

**Manny**, 31: Storage yard manager.
Manny manages the yard for the absentee landlord and lives in a little room behind the office.
He seems to be everywhere at the yard and simultaneously absent most of the time, like a ghost.
On the side, Manny is growing weed in units whose tenants have abandoned them; he siphons power off the grid for his hydroponics.
Manny represents the path of indefinite deferral in decisions about baggage.
He is so at home in the purgatory that he has a role in maintaining it.

**Other Tenants**: Each has a different way of dealing with his or her baggage.
In little vignettes, they demonstrate that Tom has many options, most of them unhappy.

**Suitcase**: The suitcase holds the hardest artifacts for Tom to deal with.
Tom avoids opening the suitcase until act III, and then with great apprehension.
The suitcase is visible in every shot of the unit's interior, as a reminder of the tough issues Tom is avoiding.
