# Our Collaborative Writing Process

We look for actors who want to tell stories.
We ask a simple question--if you could make a film about anything, what kind of story would *you* tell?
We look for stories that are grounded in the actors' real-life emotional experience.
We can build bigger stories around actors who want to share more of their introspection.
Some actors are willing to do more of this work than others, and they become our leads.

With the leads in place, we can put together a skeleton of a story.
We know where the characters start, and where they end up.
We know the main challenges and conflicts in the story, and how the story resolves them.
We can make a rough list of supporting character and start casting in the more traditional sense.
The story sets some parameters, but mostly we leave it up to the actors to come up with their characters.
A mentor is generally older than the protagonist, but can be any gender and any ethnicity.
The casting choice affects the story, and we welcome ideas from actors that challenge us.
If an actor can explain how an idea drives the bigger story forward, we can use it.

Now that we have a cast and character arcs, we can refine the treatment into a scene breakdown.
For every scene, we know how it drives the story forward.
We know where each scene begins and where it ends.
We know who is in the scene.
So for each scene, we get the actors in a room, and ask them to improvise.
We run the improv as many times as it takes to get the scene to feel right.
Then we stop the tape and transcribe the dialogue.
This becomes our screenplay.

To be clear--we have a complete screenplay before principal photography starts.
On the set, on location, with crew waiting, we have no time to improvise.
The improv happens ahead of time, in a comfortable, air-conditioned room, with only a few people present.

Our process requires significant commitment from actors and extensive preproduction.
Our result is a screenplay where every character has a unique voice, a cast that is in touch with their characters and a drama-free set.

We like drama in our stories.
Our sets we like boring.
