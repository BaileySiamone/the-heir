Our Collaborative Writing Process

We look for actors who want to tell stories.
We ask a simple question--if you could make a film about anything, what kind of story would YOU tell?
We look for stories that are personally meaningful to the actors.
Not autobiographical, but grounded in the actors' emotional experience.
We can build the bigger stories around actors who are willing to share more of their introspection.
Some actors are more willing to do this work than other, and that's how we select our leads.

With one or two leads, we can put together a skeleton of a story where the character start, and where they end up.
We know the main challenges and conflicts in the story.

Now we can sketch additional characters the story would need.
Does the protagonist need an antagonist?
A love interest?
An ally?
We can make a rough character list and start casting in the more traditional sense.
We are looking for actors who relate to the story and their character's purpose in it.
The story sets some parameters, but mostly we leave it up to the actors to come up with their characters.
A mentor would generally be older than the protagonist, but can be any gender and any ethnicity.
When an actor asks about the character's backstory, our answer is inevitably: you tell me.
If the actor can explain how an idea drives the bigger story forward, we can use it.

Now that we have a cast and character stories, we can refine the treatment into a scene breakdown.
For every scene, we know how it drives the story forward.
We knew where each scene begins and where it ends.
We know who is in the scene.
So for each scene, we get the actors in a room, and ask them to improvise.
We run the improv as many times as it takes to get the scene to feel right.
Then we stop the tape and transcribe the dialogue.
This becomes our screenplay.

To be clear--we have a complete screenplay before principal photography starts.
On the set, on location, with a crew waiting, we have no time to improvise.
The improv happens ahead of time, in a comfortable, air-conditioned room, with only a few people present.

Our process requires significant commitment from actors and extensive preproduction.
The result is
