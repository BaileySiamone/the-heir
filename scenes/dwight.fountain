EXT. STORAGE YARD ALLEY - DAY #meet-dwight#

Manny is walking Howard along a row of storage units.

*Manny's banter*

Howard notices a [red lock](prop) on a unit.

HOWARD
How come this door has two locks on it?

MANNY
That means a tenant is behind on rent.
We put these on until they get current again.
This way they can't get in their unit until they've paid up.

*Banter about deadbeats in general and Dwight in particular.*

Manny and Howard keep walking down the alley.
