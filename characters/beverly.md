**Beverly** the biker, 59: takes in other people's problems.
Beverly stores project motorcycles in various states of disrepair.
Each belongs to a different ex-boyfriend.
She keeps paying rent on these bikes long after their owners abandoned them and her.
She keeps them out of a combination of guilt and hope that the owners return one day to restore the bikes and the relationship.
