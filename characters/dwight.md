**Dwight** the defaulter, makes his problems other people's problems.
Dwight thinks he will live forever, so he can defer decisions indefinitely.
For years, Dwight has delayed paying his rent until days before his unit is placed in default and moved to auction.
He does this over and over, not wanting deal with his past but also not wanting to lose it.
Now that the yard is closing, Dwight shows up and tries to haggle his stuff back.
There is a double lock on his unit because, as usual, heâ€™s months behind on rent.
