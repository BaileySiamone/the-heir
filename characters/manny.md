**Manny** the storage manager, 65: the wise old man (or woman, depending on casting).
Like a bartender or pawnshop operator, Manny observes the characters without intervening in their drama.
At intervals, (s)he offers observations on the meaning of life and characters' predicaments.
The observations are spot on, but their wisdom is obscure to the characters.
