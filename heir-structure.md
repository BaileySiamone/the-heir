THE HEIR
========

Inheriting a storage unit full of family heirlooms forces an estranged son to confront his place in the family.

STRUCTURE
=========

Open
----
TOM opens the roll-up door to his father's old storage unit and surveys his inheritance with disdain.

Act I: Pose the Question
-----
Tom hates cleaning up the messes that his family refuses to deal with.
Tom explains to CLAIRE, his next-door neighbor, that his family has been been kicking the can down the road for generations.
His storage unit contains the parts of family history that they never dealt with.
Now it falls to Tom to piece together his identity.
Tom complains specifically about his step-brother DRAKE, whose identity is shallow but secure.
Tom asks the central question: if he throws away his (family's) baggage, who is he?
And if he keeps it, will it crush him?

Plot Point
----------
Storage yard manger MANNY announces pending closure and demolition of the yard.
Tenants have thirty days to vacate.
Tom must decide what he does with his inheritance.

Act IIa: Fun and Games
-------
The stuff in the unit is not all bad.
Tom discovers some of his old toys.
He discovers his parents' toys, old cameras, vinyl records--it's a hipster's paradise.
Other tenants want to be Tom's friends.
Tom's friendship with Claire grows, they play old video games together and model old-fashioned clothes for each other.
Tom finds awards and citations, certificates of achievement, that paint Tom's family in a new light.
Tom finds role models, sources of pride and identity in these artifacts.

Midpoint
--------
Drake arrives and helps himself to the best of Tom's finds.
The confrontation drives home the reality of Tom's challenges, including his inability to set boundaries.

Act IIb: Stuff Gets Real
-------
Tom keeps digging through the storage unit.
He finds arrest records, ER admission records, divorce papers.
For comic relief, an anatomical skeleton spills out when Tom opens a cabinet in his unit.
Importantly, Tom is no longer dealing with his crisis alone.
Claire is there to support him.
Claire helps Tom see that the happy and the unhappy memories are his equally.
Tom finds that he can draw strength and wisdom from unseemly episodes in family history.
They, too, are part of what makes him him, and he can learn from failure as much as from success.

Plot Point
----------
Tom and Claire cuddle aggressively in her unit (we see this from Tom's unit).
As the shared wall thud-thuds, the suitcase falls from its shelf, spilling its contents.
When Tom discovers the mess in the morning, he has to face the more serious skeletons in his storage unit.

Act III: Resolution
-------
Tom now has the strength and the allies to deal with the harder stuff.
He gets a dumpster for the things he wants to discard, a scanning service to digitize photos, a box that's going to Goodwill, etc.
The objects Tom wants to keep he packs into the Suitcase.
He finds some artifacts that belong, in his opinion, to Drake and calls him to pick up his stuff.
In the second confrontation with Drake, Tom is on his turf.
He and Drake are never going to be friends, and in fact may never speak again, but the torment is over.
Tom has sorted through his inheritance and owns his life free and clear.

Close
-----
Tom surveys the empty storage unit with satisfaction, rolls down the door, gets in the car (Claire is waiting in the passenger seat) and drives away with the few heirlooms he decided to keep packed into the suitcase, which is visible through the tailgate.


Characters
==========
**Tom**, 28: Lonely, isolated, listless, the weight of the world on his shoulders.

**Claire**, 25: Girl-next-door, literally--has the storage unit next to Tom's.
Tom's eventual love interest.
Tom's foil: he can describe to her the significance of objects he finds.
Claire is using her unit to store possessions following a breakup.
She, too, has stuff to sort through, but less than Tom.

**Drake**, 29: Tom's step-brother.
High school football star, ladies' man and all-American pride and joy of his parents.
Golden child and Tom's nemesis throughout their childhood.
Drake may be absent physically in act I, but Tom's recollections and complaints introduce him from the start.
Drake peaked at 19 as a college football rookie and is unwilling to accept this disappointment.
Nothing happened in his life in the decade since, and is unlikely to happen ever again.
Drake represents the path of accepting only happy facts and ignoring the disappointing.

Alternatively, **Drake**, 59, Tom's step-father.
Peaked as a college quarterback who never went pro.

**Manny**, 31: Storage yard manager.
Manny manages the yard for the absentee landlord and lives in a little room behind the office.
He seems to be everywhere at the yard and simultaneously absent most of the time, like a ghost.
On the side, Manny is growing weed in units whose tenants have abandoned them; he siphons power off the grid for his hydroponics.
Manny represents the path of indefinite deferral in decisions about baggage.
He is so at home in the purgatory that he has a role in maintaining it.

**Other Tenants**: Each has a different way of dealing with his or her baggage.
In little vignettes, they demonstrate that Tom has many options, most of them unhappy.

**Suitcase**: The suitcase holds the hardest artifacts for Tom to deal with.
Tom avoids opening the suitcase until act III, and then with great apprehension.
The suitcase is visible in every shot of the unit's interior, as a reminder of the tough issues Tom is avoiding.

Characters' confusion over their identities
-------------------------------------------

Few of the characters know who they are, who they can be, or even who they want to be.
Many of the characters hold on to bizarre bits of family trivia as the source of their worth and identity.
One boasts a great-grandmother who had a brief affair with the heir of General Lee.
Another has an uncle who was the initial investor in Yahoo.
Though none can show evidence or benefit of these claims, they repeat them as a refrain.
