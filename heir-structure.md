THE HEIR
========

Inheriting a storage unit full of family heirlooms forces an estranged son to confront his place in the family.

STRUCTURE
=========

Open
----
TOM opens the roll-up door to his father's old storage unit and surveys his inheritance with disdain.

Act I: Pose the Question
-----
Tom hates cleaning up the messes that his family refuses to deal with.
Tom explains to CLAIRE, his next-door neighbor, that his family has been been kicking the can down the road for generations.
His storage unit contains the parts of family history that they never dealt with.
Now it falls to Tom to piece together his identity.
Tom complains specifically about his step-brother DRAKE, whose identity is shallow but secure.
Tom asks the central question: if he throws away his (family's) baggage, who is he?
And if he keeps it, will it crush him?

Plot Point
----------
Storage yard MANGER announces pending closure and demolition of the yard.
Tenants have thirty days to vacate.
Tom must decide what he does with his inheritance.

Act IIa: Fun and Games
-------
The stuff in the unit is not all bad.
Tom discovers some of his old toys.
He discovers his parents' toys, old cameras, vinyl records--it's a hipster's paradise.
Tom befriends Claire and some of the other tenants, they play old video games together and model old-fashioned clothes for each other.
There are awards and citations, certificates of achievement, that paint Tom's family in a new light.
Tom finds role models, sources of pride and identity in these artifacts.

Midpoint
--------
Drake arrives and helps himself to the best of Tom's finds.
The confrontation drives home the reality of Tom's challenges, including his inability to set boundaries.

Act IIb: Stuff Gets Real
-------
Tom keeps digging through the storage unit.
He finds arrest records, ER admission records, divorce papers.
For comic relief, an anatomical skeleton spills out when Tom opens a cabinet in his unit.
Importantly, Tom is no longer dealing with his crisis alone.
Claire is there to support him.
Claire helps Tom see that the happy and the unhappy memories are his equally.
Tom finds that he can draw strength and wisdom from unseemly episodes in family history.
They, too, are part of what makes him him, and he can learn from failure as much as from success.

Plot Point
----------
Tom and Claire cuddle aggressively in her unit (we see this from Tom's unit).
As the shared wall thud-thuds, the suitcase falls from its shelf, spilling its contents.
When Tom discovers the mess in the morning, he has to face the more serious skeletons in his storage unit.

Act III: Resolution
-------

Close
-----
Tom surveys the empty storage unit with satisfaction, rolls down the door, gets in the car (Claire is waiting in the passenger seat) and drives away with the few heirlooms he decided to keep visible through the tailgate.
