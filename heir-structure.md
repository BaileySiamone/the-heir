THE HEIR
========

Inheriting a storage unit full of family heirlooms forces an estranged son to confront his place in the family.

STRUCTURE
=========

Open
----
TOM, 28, opens the roll-up door to his father's old storage unit and surveys his inheritance with disdain. His gaze focuses on a particular SUITCASE.

Act I: Pose the Question
-----
For three generations, Tom's family stuffed anything they didn't want to deal with into the unit.
Now it falls to Tom to clean up the mess and piece together his identity.
Storage yard manger MANNY, 31, introduces Tom to his next-unit neighbor CLAIRE, 25, and other tenants.
Tom complains about his step-brother DRAKE, whose identity is shallow but secure.
Tom asks the central question: if he throws away his (family's) baggage, who is he?
And if he keeps it, will it crush him?

Plot Point
----------
Manny announces pending closure and demolition of the yard.
Tenants have thirty days to vacate.
Tom must decide what he does with his inheritance.

Act IIa: Fun and Games
-------
The stuff in the unit is not all bad.
Tom discovers some of his old toys.
He discovers his parents' toys, old cameras, vinyl records--it's a hipster's paradise.
Other tenants want to be Tom's friends.
Tom's friendship with Claire grows, they play old video games together and model old-fashioned clothes for each other.
Tom finds awards and citations, certificates of achievement, that paint Tom's family in a new light.
Tom finds role models, sources of pride and identity in these artifacts.

Midpoint
--------
Drake arrives and helps himself to the best of Tom's finds.
The confrontation drives home the reality of Tom's challenges, including his inability to set boundaries.

Act IIb: Stuff Gets Real
-------
Tom keeps digging through the storage unit.
He finds arrest records, ER admission records, divorce papers.
For comic relief, an anatomical skeleton spills out when Tom opens a cabinet in his unit.
Importantly, Tom is no longer dealing with his crisis alone.
Claire is there to support him.
Claire helps Tom see that the happy and the unhappy memories are his equally.
Tom finds that he can draw wisdom from unseemly episodes in family history.
They, too, are part of what makes him him, and he can learn from failure as much as from success.

Plot Point
----------
Tom and Claire cuddle aggressively in her unit (we see this from Tom's unit).
As the shared wall thud-thuds, the Suitcase falls from its shelf, spilling its contents.
When Tom discovers the mess in the morning, he has to face the more serious skeletons in his storage unit.

Act III: Resolution
-------
Tom now has the strength and the allies to deal with the harder stuff.
He gets a dumpster for the things he wants to discard, a scanning service to digitize photos, a box that's going to Goodwill, etc.
The objects Tom wants to keep he packs into the Suitcase.
He finds some artifacts that belong, in his opinion, to Drake and calls him to pick up his stuff.
In the second confrontation with Drake, Tom is on his turf.
He and Drake are never going to be friends, and in fact may never speak again, but the torment is over.
Tom has sorted through his inheritance and owns his life free and clear.

Close
-----
Tom surveys the empty storage unit with satisfaction, rolls down the door, gets in the car (Claire is waiting in the passenger seat) and drives away with the few heirlooms he decided to keep packed into the Suitcase, which is visible through the tailgate.


Characters
==========
**Tom**, 28: At the outset: lonely, isolated, listless, the weight of the world on his shoulders.

**Claire**, 25: Girl-next-door, literally--has the storage unit next to Tom's.
Tom's eventual love interest.
Tom's foil: he can describe to her the significance of objects he finds.
Claire is using her unit to store possessions following a breakup.
She, too, has stuff to sort through, but less than Tom.

**Drake**, 29: Tom's step-brother.
High school football star, ladies' man and all-American pride and joy of his parents.
Golden child and Tom's nemesis throughout their childhood.
Drake may be absent physically in act I, but Tom's recollections and complaints introduce him from the start.
Drake peaked at 19 as a college football rookie and is unwilling to accept this disappointment.
Nothing happened in his life in the decade since, and is unlikely to happen ever again.
Drake represents the path of accepting only happy facts and ignoring the disappointing.

Alternatively, **Drake**, 59, Tom's step-father.
Peaked as a college quarterback who never went pro.

**Manny**, 31: Storage yard manager.
Manny manages the yard for the absentee landlord and lives in a little room behind the office.
He seems to be everywhere at the yard and simultaneously absent most of the time, like a ghost.
On the side, Manny is growing weed in units whose tenants have abandoned them; he siphons power off the grid for his hydroponics.
Manny represents the path of indefinite deferral in decisions about baggage.
He is so at home in the purgatory that he has a role in maintaining it.

**Other Tenants**: Each has a different way of dealing with his or her baggage.
In little vignettes, they demonstrate that Tom has many options, most of them unhappy.

**Suitcase**: The suitcase holds the hardest artifacts for Tom to deal with.
Tom avoids opening the suitcase until act III, and then with great apprehension.
The suitcase is visible in every shot of the unit's interior, as a reminder of the issues Tom is avoiding.


Motifs
======

Characters' confusion over their identities
-------------------------------------------

Few of the characters know who they are, who they can be, or even who they want to be.
Many of the characters hold on to bizarre bits of family trivia as the source of their worth and identity.
One boasts a great-grandmother who had a brief affair with the heir of General Lee.
Another has an uncle who was the initial investor in Yahoo.
Though none can show evidence or benefit of these claims, they repeat them as a refrain.


Love and Responsibility
-----------------------

Claire left her previous boyfriend over his refusal to grow up and take responsibility for his own life.
Claire won't say it outright (she doesn't think anyone wants to hear it), but she's ready to take responsibility for a child's life in addition to her own.
Tom, when we first meet him, never wants to have children of his own.
He helps a child retrieve a lost toy. "You're so good with children," the mother says, but Tom looks away with embarrassment.
His own childhood was awful, and he's sure that he'd give an awful experience to his children, if he had any.
As he finds his footing and learns to respect himself, Tom breaks out of his isolation.
He discovers that he enjoys being with other people, and leading them.
His and Claire's stories converge as Tom discovers his drive to make something bigger than himself.
At the end of the story, Tom is ready to be the head of a family, to be responsible for people who depend on him.
