**Penny** the pianist, 25: girl-next-door--literally.
Has the storage unit next to Howard's.
Penny keeps her grandmother's grand piano in her unit.
She hopes one day to recapture the glamour of playing it for her guests.
As part of her arc, Penny gives up on trying to recycle past generations' fabulous--and decides to make her own.
For the grandma, the piano was a status symbol; it represented the leisure available to her family to learn and play music.
Penny needs to find a modern-day equivalent to aspire to.
