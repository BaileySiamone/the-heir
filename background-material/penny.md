**Penny** the pianist, 24: chasing an impossible dream.
Penny keeps her grandmother's grand piano in her unit.
She hopes one day to recapture the glamour of playing it for her guests.
As part of her arc, Penny gives up on trying to recycle past generations' fabulous--and decides to make her own.

<!--
For the grandma, the piano was a status symbol.
More than the price of the instrument itself, it represented the leisure available to her family to learn and play music.
Penny needs to find a modern-day equivalent to aspire to.

<!--
Penny uses her storage unit as an informal studio.
There may be rudimentary soundproofing, but other tenants complain about the noise.
Manny uses this as a pretext for sexual advances: her can be lenient with her if she is with him.
He has no chance with Penny and knows it.
He is playing to lose.
