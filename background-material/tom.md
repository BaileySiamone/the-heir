**Tom** the protagonist, 28.
For three generations, Tom's relatives have been stuffing everything they didn't want to deal with into a storage unit.
Now the sole rightful heir to this legacy, Tom must decide what to do about it.
Tom refuses to take an easy way out: add to the pile, burn it, abandon it, etc.
Instead, Tom sorts through the artifacts and pieces together a new, more authentic identity for himself.
In the process, Tom makes friends, reconnects with extended family and becomes a more complete person.

<!--
Along the way, Tom meets other tenants at the storage yard.
Each of these characters has a different way of dealing with their baggage.
In a way, each represents alternatives available to Tom, and shows what happens if Tom takes that path.

<!--
Doesn't (want to) fit in boxes - yet here he is sorting though one.
Wants to be the life of the party.
Initially envies Manny's easy-going, boundary-free antics.
