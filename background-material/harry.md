**Harry** the hoarder, 43: never lets go of anything.
His unit is full of old cereal boxes, old utility bills and old car parts.
Maintaining his hoard is a full-time job.
Harry has no room in his life for relationships or even for enjoying his stuff.

<!--
Harry is like a living Mad Tea Party from Alice in Wonderland.
Every time his unit gets full, he moves to a larger one.
Having to leave this facility is an excuse for Harry to rent bigger unit somewhere else.
