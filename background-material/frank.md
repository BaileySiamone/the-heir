**Frank** the step-father, 59: Howard's father figure.
Has severe boundary issues.
Peaked as a college quarterback who never went pro.
Nothing happened in his life since, and is unlikely to happen ever again.
Frank is willing to accept only happy baggage and ignores the disappointments.
To fill his entire life with the little happy baggage he has, Frank exaggerates it.
One of his worries is that Howard might find evidence of this exaggeration in his storage unit.
