**Hannah** the hoarder, 62: never lets go of anything.
Her unit is full of old cereal boxes, old utility bills and old car parts.
Maintaining her hoard is a full-time job.
Hannah has no room in her life for relationships or even for enjoying her stuff.

<!--
Harry is like a living Mad Tea Party from Alice in Wonderland.
Every time his unit gets full, he moves to a larger one.
Having to leave this facility is an excuse for Harry to rent bigger unit somewhere else.
