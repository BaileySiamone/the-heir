**Manny** the storage manager, 31: runs the yard for its absentee landlord.
Lives in a little room behind the office.
He seems to be everywhere at the yard and simultaneously absent most of the time, like a ghost.
On the side, Manny is growing weed in empty units; he siphons power off the grid for his hydroponics.
<!--Manny represents the path of indefinite deferral in decisions about baggage.-->
He is so at home in the purgatory that he has a role in maintaining it.
