**Manny**, 31: Storage yard manager.
Manny manages the yard for the absentee landlord and lives in a little room behind the office.
He seems to be everywhere at the yard and simultaneously absent most of the time, like a ghost.
On the side, Manny is growing weed in units whose tenants have abandoned them; he siphons power off the grid for his hydroponics.
Manny represents the path of indefinite deferral in decisions about baggage.
He is so at home in the purgatory that he has a role in maintaining it.
