# Character Studies

Each character has a different way of dealing with his or her baggage.
Protagonist's growth is largely around finding a new relationship with his.
Secondary characters demonstrate, in little vignettes, that Tom has many options--most of them unhappy.

# Tom's Family Tree

Part of Tom's arc is piecing together his family history.
He's heard of all these cousins and uncles but has never been able to follow the relationships.
When he's done tracing the family tree, it looks like this: `toms-family-tree.csv`.
This file works with genealogy software at <https://gramps-project.org>.


Few of Tom's relatives show up on screen, except in the final party where Tom's family and friends come together.
