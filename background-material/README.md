# Character Studies

Each character has a different way of dealing with his or her baggage.
Protagonist's growth is largely around finding a new relationship with his.
Secondary characters demonstrate, in little vignettes, that Howard has many options--most of them unhappy.

# Howard's Family Tree

Part of Howard's arc is piecing together his family history.
He's heard of all these cousins and uncles but has never been able to follow the relationships.
When he's done tracing the family tree, it looks like this: `howards-family-tree.csv`.
This file works with genealogy software at <https://gramps-project.org>.


Few of Howard's relatives show up on screen, except in the final party where Howard's family and friends come together.
