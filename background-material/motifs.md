Characters' confusion over their identities
-------------------------------------------

Few of the characters know who they are, who they can be, or even who they want to be.
Many of the characters hold on to bizarre bits of family trivia as the source of their worth and identity.
One boasts a great-grandmother who had a brief affair with the heir of General Lee.
Another has an uncle who was the initial investor in Yahoo.
Though none can show evidence or benefit of these claims, they repeat them as a refrain.


Love and Responsibility
-----------------------

Claire left her previous boyfriend over his refusal to grow up and take responsibility for his own life.
Claire won't say it outright (she doesn't think anyone wants to hear it), but she's ready to take responsibility for a child's life in addition to her own.
Tom, when we first meet him, never wants to have children of his own.
He helps a child retrieve a lost toy. "You're so good with children," the mother says, but Tom looks away with embarrassment.
His own childhood was awful, and he's sure that he'd give an awful experience to his children, if he had any.
As he finds his footing and learns to respect himself, Tom breaks out of his isolation.
He discovers that he enjoys being with other people, and leading them.
His and Claire's stories converge as Tom discovers his drive to make something bigger than himself.
At the end of the story, Tom is ready to be the head of a family, to be responsible for people who depend on him.
