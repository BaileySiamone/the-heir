# The Heir Brainstorm

Penny's big problem is guilt.
Starting with her hypochondriac mother and ending with the polar ice caps, everyone's problems are more important than Penny's.
Penny never wants to resolve conflicts of interest.
If she has no interests, they can never conflict with anyone else's.

The piano belongs to her mother, who fantasizes about the glory days of *her* mother's fancy parties.
In the meantime, she neglects to pay rent on the storage unit, and it's Penny's job to put things right with Manny.
At regular intervals, Penny must rescue the piano from repossession.
Rescuing the piano and trying to move it for her mother is what brings Penny to the storage yard in the first place.

Penny's arc is to acknowledge the conflict--and eventually to resolve it.
Penny has a choice about whose problems are more important.
The visible manifestation of this growth is her decision to stop rescuing the piano.

Some of the objects Howard may find that evoke his conflict with the family, and force him to reevaluate what he knows:

**Pill bottles.** The bottles now hold beads or dollhouse parts.
The sheer number of bottles and their labels force Howard to confront facts that he always knew but refused to assemble into an inevitable conclusion.
Official family story is frugality and reuse.
The story Howard must face is prescription substance abuse.

**Fishing gear.** Barely used, some still in store packaging.
Official family story is Howard's fishing weekends with his father (or step-father?).
The story Howard must confront is co-dependency with Frank's drinking.
How did he feel about cleaning up Frank's mess?
How old was he when he had his first drink at the lake?

**Shoeboxes with stripper heels in Moira's size.** Did Moira have her own fun while Frank and Howard were out "fishing?"
Maybe Frank and Moira had an understanding about partying with other people on weekends.
Or maybe they didn't.
Howard must decide how he deals with his parents' morals.

Penny starts out as a rescuer.
This may explain her act-one attraction to Howard.
Everyone in the world has problems that Penny wants to solve.
She even wants to solve global problems.
The only one in the world without problems is Penny.

So what *are* Penny's problems?
We need to know what her problems are, so she can resolve them.

She is afraid of commitment.
We don't know what is scary to her about commitment.

Penny's arc culminates in her stepping out of her rescuing game, similar to how Howard steps out of his victim game.

Anna is totally inappropriate.
Half the time, it's hard to tell if she's oblivious or passive-aggressive.
She might walk in on Manny's hydroponic operation, complimenting him on the quality of his plants--and then start taking photos of them.
When Manny protests, she might explain her intrusion as admiration,
"I'm going to show these at the garden show!"

After Anna burns her baggage and loses her memory, she is indenial about it.
Trying to get other people to tell her who she is, she scolds other characters with gusto:
"I bet you don't even know my name!"
