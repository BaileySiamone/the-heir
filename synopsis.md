The Blank family is careful about the image they present to the world.
They curate their photos, their appearances and their memories.
Anything they dislike about themselves, they stuff into a self-storage unit.
The Blanks have been so effective at scrubbing their facade, it consists almost entirely of blank spots.

For three generations, the Blanks' insecurities have stayed out of sight.
Now their locker is overflowing and the landlord is threatening eviction.
Howard, the 28-year-old heir to the Blank fortune, must sort through his unit now--or forever give up knowing who he really is.

Will Howard make peace with his baggage, or will the baggage trap him forever?
